## ... me:
Welcome to my portfolio!
I'm Lucho, a software developer from Argentina. I've been programming since 2002. Currently I develop software professionally and as a hobby.

## ... this project:
This is an experimental project. The idea was to make a frontend that presents my developments and products, simulating being in a graphical environment like Windows.

This portfolio was developed in Angular 10, using Bootstrap and a lot of scss. I've tried to avoid using external libraries.

Dependencies:
* animate.css *- css animations*
* bootstrap
* firebase *- login and storage*
